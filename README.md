# The Swagger Specification

Welcome to the Swagger Project.

The goal of Swagger is to assist in REST-ful API description and allow for simple automatic and manual integrations.
The Swagger Specification is a set of guidelines and rules to produce such an API documentation, which is a common base for all other tools.

Swagger-enabled APIs are ones that expose JSON files that follow the Swagger Specification.
These files can either be produced and served statically, or be generated dynamically from your application.

If you're familiar with SOAP and WSDL, then Swagger is the WSDL to REST.
You may be familiar with WADL, but we find this standard to be cumbersome to use, and offer this simple, alternative method of exposing your APIs.

This GitHub project is the starting point for Swagger.
Here you will find the information you need about the Swagger Specification, a simple static sample of what it looks like,
and some general information regarding the project.

## Current Version - 1.2

The current version of the Swagger specification is 1.2 - and you can find it [here](1.2.md).

Please keep in mind that the other projects under Swagger use an independent version system.
As such, don't confuse the version of the Swagger Specification they support and the version of that given library.
For example, Swagger-Core with the version 1.3.2 supports Swagger Specification 1.2.

## The Wiki

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/wiki) for additional and relevant information about the project.

This includes:
- Static sample tutorial.
- List of known deployments.
- Revision history

## Support

The following methods are available to obtain support for Swagger:

- [The Swagger Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swagger-swaggersocket) - This would normally be your first stop to get support for Swagger. Here you can find previously asked question, and ask new ones. When asking a question, please provide as much information as you can regarding the environment you use (development language, library, versions.
- The Issues tab of the respective project in GitHub. Please open feature requests and bugs here. If you're not sure you encountered a bug, or if it's a general usage question, please use the Google Group mentioned above.
- IRC! you can find us on [freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net) in the channel #Swagger. You can talk with us directly there.

Keep in mind that if you have an issue with a specific community-driven library, you may want to ask in their respective support channels.

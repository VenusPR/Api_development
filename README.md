# The Swagger Specification

Welcome to the Swagger Project.

The goal of Swagger is to assist in REST-ful API description and allow for simple automatic and manual integrations.
The Swagger Specification is a set of guidelines and rules to produce such an API documentation, which is a common base for all other tools.

Swagger-enabled APIs are ones that expose JSON files that follow the Swagger Specification.
These files can either be produced and served statically, or be generated dynamically from your application.

If you're familiar with SOAP and WSDL, then Swagger is the WSDL to REST.
You may be familiar with WADL, but we find this standard to be cumbersome to use, and offer this simple, alternative method of exposing your APIs.

This GitHub project is the starting point for Swagger.
Here you will find the information you need about the Swagger Specification, and a simple static sample of what it looks like.

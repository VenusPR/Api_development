# The OpenAPI Specification

This is the working branch for the next version of the OpenAPI Specification. You can read more about the Open API Initiative (OAI) at [https://openapis.org](https://openapis.org).

The current, released version of the OpenAPI Specification is 2.0, through donation of the Swagger Specification to the OAI by SmartBear Software.  If you are interested in the release specification, please see the [master branch](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/README.md) of this project.

Development of the next version of the OpenAPI Specification is being guided by the [OAI Technical Contributors Board](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/CONTRIBUTORS.md).  This group of committers will be bring their API expertise, incorporating feedback from the community, and expanding the group of committers as appropriate.  All development activity on the future specification will be performed as features and merged into this branch.  Upon release of the OpenAPI Specification, this branch will be merged to master.

You can see the current process for development inside the OpenAPI Specification [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Participation

The OpenAPI Specification is a community driven, open project hosted by the Linux Foundation. The OAI encourages participation from individuals and companies alike. If you wish to participate in the evolution of the OpenAPI Specification, please consider the following:

* Review the [current specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/versions/3.0.md). The human-readable markdown file _is the source of truth_ for the specification.
* Review the [development](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/DEVELOPMENT.md) process so it's clear how the spec is evolving.
* Check the [issues](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/pulls) to see if someone has already documented your idea or feedback on the specification. You can follow an existing conversation by adding a comment to the existing issue or PR.
* Create an issue to describe a new concern along with, if possible, a proposed solution.

Be aware that not all feedback can be accommodated and there may be solid arguments to/from a change being appropriate for the specification.
